If you are developing fasguard-pcap and do not wish to install it, do:

> python setup.py config <return>
> python setup.py build <return>

After this, the build/ directory should contain a "lib.<platform>"
subdirectory.  Add this to your PYTHONPATH and you can test
fasguard-pcap without performing a full installation.

Note: Make sure that you do not try to import fasguard_pcap.pcap while
you are in the top level of this tree, otherwise the Python
interpreter will search the local fasguard_pcap directory instead of
the directory containing the compiled module.

An ImportError exception will be raised, but it won't tell you that you're
trying to import a directory. This happens even if PYTHONPATH is set
correctly.
